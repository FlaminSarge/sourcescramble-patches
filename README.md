# Source Scramble Patches

This repo is (or will be) a collection of [Source Scramble](https://github.com/nosoop/SMExt-SourceScramble) patches,
intended to replace single-purpose plugins that rarely get updated.

In order to use these, you **need** the `sourcescramble_manager` plugin, which is included in Source Scramble releases.
